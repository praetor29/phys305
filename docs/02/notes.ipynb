    "   $$\n",

    "### Quantum Computing: A New Level of Number Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing takes number representation to a whole new level.\n",
    "In quantum mechanics, data is represented using quantum bits, or qubits.\n",
    "Unlike classical bits, a single qubit can exist in a superposition of two states, $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, simultaneously.\n",
    "This means that (ignoring normalization for now) one qubit can represent two numbers $C_0$ and $C_1$ as in $C_0 |0\\rangle + C_1 |1\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With two qubits, the system can represent four possible states: $|00\\rangle$, $|01\\rangle$, $|10\\rangle$, and $|11\\rangle$, again, in superposition.\n",
    "The number of possible states grows exponentially as more qubits are added:\n",
    "* Three qubits can represent eight states: $|000\\rangle$, $|001\\rangle$, $|010\\rangle$, ..., $|111\\rangle$.\n",
    "* Four qubits represent 16 states, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, $n$ qubits can represent $2^n$ states at once.\n",
    "This exponential scaling is what gives quantum computers their enormous potential to perform certain types of calculations far more efficiently than classical computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, IBM's 53-qubit quantum computer can represent $2^{53}$ states simultaneously.\n",
    "In terms of classical information, this is equivalent to storing approximately 1 petabyte (PB) of data, which is comparable to the amount of memory available in some of the world's largest supercomputers today.\n",

    "The [Superposition Hypothesis](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html) in large language models (LLMs) proposes that individual neurons or parameters can encode multiple overlapping features, depending on context.\n",
    "This is analogous to quantum superposition, where qubits represent multiple states simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a single neuron in an LLM might activate for both \"dog\" and \"pet,\" enabling efficient reuse of parameters.\n",
    "This ability is further supported by high-dimensional embeddings, where concepts are represented as nearly orthogonal vectors, allowing the model to store and distinguish vast amounts of information with minimal interference.\n",
    "The [Johnsonâ€“Lindenstrauss Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma) explains how high-dimensional spaces accommodate such efficient representations.\n",
